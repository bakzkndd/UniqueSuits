# UniqueSuits
Always confused on who is who? Can't ever have your own identity without someone else stealing it? Well worry no more!

This mod makes suits only wearable by a single person!

# Notes
- This mod requires [More Suits](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/x753/More_Suits/) to function
- Fully compatible with [TooManySuits](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Verity/TooManySuits/)!
- The default (orange) suit will always be available for multiple people to pick, this is so you can't be left with no suits, and have a way to have 2 players swap suits when all custom suits are taken already
